## Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal   
  https://tip.kaspersky.com/

### Overview
Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal provides reliable, immediate intelligence about cyber-threats, legitimate objects, their interconnections and indicators, enriched with actionable context to inform your business or clients about the associated risks and implications. Now you can mitigate and respond to threats more effectively, defending your system against attacks even before they are launched.

Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal delivers all the knowledge acquired by Kaspersky Lab about cyber-threats and their relationships, brought together into a single, powerful web service. The goal is to provide your security teams with as much data as possible in order to prevent cyber-attacks that can impact your organization. The platform retrieves the latest detailed threat intelligence about URLs, domains, IP addresses, file hashes, statistical / behavioral data, WHOIS / DNS data, and so on. The result is global visibility of new and emerging threats, helping you secure your organization and boosting incident response.

Threat intelligence is aggregated from fused, heterogeneous, and highly reliable sources. Then, in real time, all the aggregated data is carefully inspected and refined using multiple preprocessing techniques, such as statistical criteria, Kaspersky Lab expert systems, validation by analysts, and white-listing verification.

#### How it works
Indicators of compromise can be looked up through a web-based interface or Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal API. Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal enables you to request threat intelligence about the following objects
- MD5 hashes
- IP addresses
- Domains
- URLs

Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal displays whether an object is in Good, Bad, or Not categorized zones, while providing a rich set of contextual data to answer the who, what, where, and when questions that help you respond to or investigate threats more effectively.
